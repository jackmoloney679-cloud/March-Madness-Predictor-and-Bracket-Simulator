# Raw data (not committed)

This project uses the Kaggle **March Machine Learning Mania 2025** dataset.

Download the data from Kaggle and place the folder (appears in Downloads when unzipping) in the current VS Code workspace.
**Warning** : Before slidiing the CSV files listed below, make sure the **data/raw** segment is open and the **README.md** is visible. We want the CSV to be on the same level as the README.md file.

From the downloaded folder (march-machine-learning-mania-2025), select the following CSV files in the current workspace and slide them under **data/raw**:

- MNCAATourneySeeds.csv
- MNCAATourneyCompactResults.csv
- MNCAATourneySlots.csv
- MRegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv
- MTeamConferences.csv
- MTeams.csv

These files are intentionally not committed to the repository.

After placing the files here, run the full pipeline from the Terminal:

  python3 main.py
