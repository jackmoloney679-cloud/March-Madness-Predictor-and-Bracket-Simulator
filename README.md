# March-Madness-Predictor-and-Bracket-Simulator
This repository contains my final project for the Data Science and Advanced Programming class. This project aims to explore why predicting March Madness is almost impossible by building a Python-based model analysing past tournament data as well as simulating outcomes of games.

## Project Structure (Course Requirement)

This repository follows the required ML project layout:

- `main.py` is the runnable entry point (pipeline + evaluation + plots).
- `src/` contains modules that document the intended separation of concerns
  (data loading, models, evaluation). Core logic currently remains in `main.py`.
- `data/raw/` is where Kaggle CSV inputs should be placed locally (not committed).
- `results/` stores generated figures/metrics when running the pipeline.
- `notebooks/` is for exploration and prototyping.
